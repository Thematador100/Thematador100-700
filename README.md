# AudienceAI: Predictive Prospecting Engine

This is a professional-grade, AI-powered tool for market intelligence, lead expansion, and strategic opportunity discovery. It moves beyond simple data scraping to provide deep, actionable insights by analyzing a universe of data to find non-obvious correlations and buying triggers.

## Core Philosophy: Synthesis over Data Aggregation

Many market intelligence tools compete on the volume of raw data they can aggregate from various feeds (e.g., Google Trends, social media APIs). This approach is a trap. It anchors its users to the same noisy, lagging indicators that all their competitors are looking at.

This tool operates on a different, more powerful principle: **strategic synthesis**.

The AI is architected to act as an elite team of strategists (a Quantitative Analyst, a DTC Brand Architect, a Billionaire Strategist). It doesn't just read data; it synthesizes it. It analyzes a vast corpus of academic literature, public records, SEC filings, and consumer behavior data to find the "alpha"—the deep, unusual, and actionable correlations that signal a true market opportunity before it becomes common knowledge.

We don't aim to give you a better view of the same battlefield. We aim to show you an entirely new battlefield your competitors don't even know exists.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Mode Analysis:** Seamlessly switch between B2B (company-focused) and B2C (consumer-focused) analysis.
- **Strategic Briefing Interface:** Guide the AI with specific context about your goals, industry, and competitors for hyper-relevant results.
- **Lead Expansion:** Provide a list of your best customers to find thousands of "lookalike" prospects and build a detailed Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
- **Audience Discovery:** Analyze a URL or market niche to uncover up to 5 high-potential, underserved audience segments.
- **Intent Data & Buying Triggers:** Move beyond static profiles to identify concrete, evidence-based events that signal a prospect is ready to buy *now*.
- **Prospect Scoring Engine:** Score a raw list of leads against the AI-generated ICP to refine a large funnel into a curated list of high-value prospects.
- **AI Video Generation:** A dedicated module powered by Veo to generate high-quality videos from text prompts or still images.

    1.  **Monetization Strategy:** Turn a core insight into an actionable business plan.
    2.  **Billionaire Playbook:** Generate an elite, high-leverage strategy for positioning, branding, and selling the intelligence itself as a high-ticket product.
    3.  **Asymmetric Wedge Strategy (B2C):** Devise a concrete plan to instantly leapfrog and disrupt entrenched B2C competitors.

## How to Deploy to Vercel (The Easy Way)

This application is designed to be deployed easily on modern hosting platforms like Vercel. Here is a simple, non-developer-friendly guide:

1.  **Create a GitHub Account:** If you don't have one, sign up at [GitHub.com](https://github.com). It's free.

2.  **Push the Code to GitHub:** Create a new repository on GitHub and upload all the application files to it.

3.  **Create a Vercel Account:** Sign up at [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) using your GitHub account.

4.  **Import Your Project:**
    -   In your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." -> "Project".
    -   Find your new GitHub repository in the list and click "Import".
    -   Vercel will automatically detect that this is a Vite project. You don't need to change any build settings.

5.  **Add the Environment Variable (The Most Important Step):**
    -   Before you deploy, expand the "Environment Variables" section.
    -   Create a new variable with the following exact details:
        -   **Name:** `API_KEY`
        -   **Value:** Paste your Gemini API key here.
    -   Make sure there are no extra spaces before or after the name or the key. The name must be exactly `API_KEY` and not `VITE_API_KEY`.
    -   Click "Add".

6.  **Deploy:**
    -   Click the "Deploy" button.
    -   Vercel will now build and deploy your application. In about a minute, it will be live on the web, and the API key error will be gone!

## Optional: Scaling Lead Generation with Automation

The "lookalike prospects" and "Google Dork" queries generated by this tool are the strategic blueprint for your lead generation. The primary, and often most effective, method is to use these AI-generated queries for manual, high-touch prospecting on platforms like LinkedIn. The following is an optional workflow for users who need to build lists at a massive scale.

**Recommended Automation Tools:**

- **[Apify](https://apify.com/):** A powerful platform for web scraping and automation. You can build "actors" to perform complex tasks, like executing the AI's Google Dork queries and extracting profile information.
- **[Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/):** An industry-leading data collection platform, offering everything from proxies to pre-built scrapers for major social and professional networks.
- **[PhantomBuster](https://phantombuster.com/):** Specializes in automating actions on social media and professional networks. Excellent for workflows that involve LinkedIn, etc.

**The Workflow (From Blueprint to List):**

1.  **Generate the Blueprint:** Use the "B2B Lead Expansion" module to generate your list of "lookalike prospects" and their associated Google Dork queries.
2.  **Feed the Scraper:** Input the generated `googleDorkQuery` values into an Apify actor or a custom scraper built on Bright Data. The scraper's mission is to execute these searches and extract the top 10-20 results for each, collecting names, profile URLs, and any other publicly available data.
3.  **Enrich the Data:** Use a data enrichment service (many are available on Apify or as standalone APIs) to find contact information (e.g., email addresses) for the profiles you've collected.
4.  **Score & Validate (Optional):** For maximum quality, you can feed this enriched, scraped list back into the **"Prospect Scoring Engine"** module of this tool. The AI will then score your real-world list against its original ideal profile, giving you a final, prioritized "kill list."

This process transforms the AI's strategic direction into a tangible, high-quality list of leads, creating a complete, end-to-end system for market domination.

## Evolving to a Public SaaS Platform

To sell *access to the tool itself* (instead of just using it for your own consulting), you must introduce a backend to protect your API key and manage users. This prevents others from stealing and using your key.

**Strategic Blueprint:**

1.  **Secure the API Key:** Convert the API calls to instead go through your own secure backend.
2.  **Build a Backend:** Use **Vercel Serverless Functions** to create this backend. A serverless function is a piece of code that runs on Vercel's servers. It receives the request from your app, securely adds your API key (which is stored safely on the server), makes the call to the Gemini API, and then passes the response back. Your API key is never exposed to the public.
3.  **Add Authentication & Database:** Use a service like **Firebase**, **Supabase**, or **Clerk** to easily add user sign-up, login, and a database to your application.
4.  **Integrate Billing:** Use **Stripe** to manage subscriptions and payments.
